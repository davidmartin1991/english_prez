Goals of this project was many, like improve our english level, adapt to an international environnement and immerse ourselves in a different company culture.

## Malta
Malta is an european country, located at the south of sicilia in meditaarean sea.

### Why Malta ?
* First of all, Malta is an old great britain's colony , so the English is the second national language after the maltese.
* Next, Valetta the Maltese capital, was choosen to be the european capital of culture in 2018. So there was a lot of cultural event in the summer.
* And finally it was a destination which matches with my budget, because it's in europeean union so I didn't need a visa , and the flight ticket was cheap.

### Few numbers

* There are approximately 450.000 inhabitants in Malta
* The surface area is around 300 square km and for example Nantes conurbation is around 500 square km
* When malta became independant from Great Brittain => Actually It's not old, it was in 1964.
* There a lot of church in Malta, more than 360, approximately 98% of Maltese people are catholic.

### Geography
Malta is composed of 3 island, the main named Malta, a second one, Gozo which size is half of Malta, and the last one Comino, very small island just for tourism.<br/>
The blue point is the place where I worked and the red one was my home in Malta.

## Arrival
I left France from Paris the 20th of June, I was a little bit stressed because it was the first time I would live for many weeks alone in a different country but as the same time I was really excited to live this adventure.
When I arrived I had a week of vacation before start the work so I visited for few days the country.

## Eunoia
* It's a BI editor company which develop a financial software to help managers to take decisions
* There are around 10 employees who come from different countries like Poland, Venezuela, Russia, and Malta.
* Eunoia is a subsidiary of a big company , Hili ventures which employs more than 500 employees. Their biggest client is MacDonalds.

### Tasks
I was working on the BI software.
I was a full stack developer which means I worked on backend tasks using .Net and SQL Server.
As well I worked on the frontend and I used KendoUI a frontend framework and the libray jQuery.

### Office
It was normal schedules, I arrived the morning at 9 and I had one hour break the noon and I left the work a 5pm.
The team was really nice with me, they did their best to I feel well but sometimes it was hard to understand what they said. It tooks some weeks to became confident and comfortable with my english speaking.
It was a really good environment to work, manager didn't put pressure on employees, there was breakfast at work, rest area with videogames and couch.

## Home
I was staying with a local because I wanted to immerse in the maltese culture and it was less expensive. Altough it was approximately 600€ for the month.
The real estate was really high in Malta for different economic reason.
I had a personnal bedroom with the A/C. A/C is very important in Malta otherwise you can't sleep the night it's too warm.
It was a good experience because the family shows me their culture and habits but sometimes it was hard because you never really feel like at home.

## Visit
I tried to enjoy as much as possible the country. I went to hike, to swim, to bike, to scuba-diving, to party and more else.
I met great people in Malta.
It was a very interesting experience because I discover a new country, a new culture, but I also learn about myself during this trip.
For example before I was sure that I wanted to work abroad but now I change my mind, I like France and I am feeling good here.
